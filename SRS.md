## Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive software requirements specification for the Duolingo language learning application. This document will serve as a reference for the development team and stakeholders involved in the project to ensure that the final product meets the requirements and expectations of all parties involved.

There are over 1.2 billion people learning a language and the majority are doing so to gain access to better opportunities. Unfortunately, learning a language is expensive and inaccessible to most. We created Duolingo so that everyone could have a chance. Free language education – no hidden fees, no premium content, just free.

Duolingo is used by the richest man in the world and many Hollywood stars, and at the same time by public schools students in developing countries. We believe true equality is when spending more can't buy you a better education.
